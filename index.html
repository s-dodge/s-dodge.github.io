The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.

                        This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto. Its effect on table-*-group, table-row, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined</td>

                        <br><br>
                        This value always creates a new stacking context. In printed documents, the element is placed in the same position on every page.</td>

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.
                        <br><br>
                        This value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn't the nearest actually scrolling ancestor</td>
